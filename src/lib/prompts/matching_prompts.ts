Generate ${config.quantity} matching question(s) based on the content below.

${difficultyInstruction}
${typeInstruction}
${bloomInstruction}

Requirements:
- Create 4-6 matching pairs per question
- Base answers strictly on provided content
- Ensure clear, logical relationships
- No ambiguous matches

Content:
"""
${config.content}
"""

Output JSON array only:

    "question": "Match items in Column A with Column B",
    "matching_questions": [
      {"1": "Column A item 1", "A": "Column B item (shuffled)"},

      {"3": "Column A item 3", "C": "Column B item (shuffled)"}

      {"3": "Column A item 3", "B": "Correct Column B item"}
    ]${config.difficulty === DifficultyLevel.HIGH ? ',\n    "explanation": "Brief explanation"' : ''}
  }
]

IMPORTANT: 
- matching_questions: Show Column A items with Column B items in RANDOM order (shuffled)
- matching_answers: Show the CORRECT pairings between Column A and Column B
- Column B items in matching_questions should be shuffled/randomized
- Column B keys in matching_answers should match the correct Column B items from matching_questions`;
