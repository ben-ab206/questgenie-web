TASK: Generate Long Answer Questions
${difficultyInstruction}
${lengthInstruction}
${bloomInstruction}

LONG ANSWER SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create exactly ${config.quantity} long answer question(s)
2. Each question must require comprehensive, detailed responses
3. Base ALL questions and answers strictly on the provided content below
4. Do not use external knowledge beyond the given content
5. Questions should test deep understanding, analysis, and synthesis
6. Require multi-paragraph responses with structured arguments
7. Include questions that need explanation of processes, relationships, or concepts
8. Ensure questions promote critical thinking and detailed elaboration

CONTENT TO ANALYZE:
"""
${config.content}

- Focus on explaining basic concepts and processes from the content
- Ask questions requiring description and simple analysis
- Use question words like "Explain how...", "Describe why...", "What are the steps..."
- Answers should demonstrate understanding of fundamental concepts
- Require 2-3 main points with supporting details`,

    [DifficultyLevel.MEDIUM]: `DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM  
- Test comprehension of complex relationships and cause-effect patterns
- Ask questions requiring comparison, contrast, and analysis
- Include questions about applications, implications, and connections
- Require synthesis of multiple concepts from different sections
- Answers should demonstrate deeper analytical thinking with 3-4 main points
- Include questions like "Compare and contrast...", "Analyze the relationship...", "Evaluate the impact..."`,

    [DifficultyLevel.HIGH]: `DIFFICULTY: HIGH
- Require critical evaluation, synthesis, and complex analysis
