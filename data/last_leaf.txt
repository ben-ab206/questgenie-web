"The Last Leaf"

An old painter named Behrman lived in a small, cold apartment in a quiet city. For decades, he had dreamed of painting a masterpiece, but it never happened. He spent his days helping younger artists in the building and complaining about how he would one day create something great.

Downstairs, a young woman named Johnsy had fallen ill. She lay in bed, staring out the window at a brick wall covered with ivy. As her sickness grew worse, she became obsessed with the leaves falling off the vine. “When the last leaf falls,” she whispered, “I will die.”

Her best friend and roommate, Sue, tried to comfort her, but nothing worked. The doctor said Johnsy had lost the will to live.

That night, a storm came. Wind howled, rain poured, and the last leaf should have fallen.

But in the morning, when Johnsy opened her eyes, one leaf still clung to the vine.

She stared at it all day. And the next. And the next.

Slowly, hope returned to her eyes. She recovered.

What she didn’t know was that the last leaf wasn’t real. Behrman had gone out in the storm to paint it on the wall.

He caught pneumonia and died two days later.

But he had finally painted his masterpiece.
